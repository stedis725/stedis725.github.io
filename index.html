        <h2>Steven DiSilvio</h2>

        <p>Hi there! I'm Steven DiSilvio, a current undergraduate at Columbia double-majoring in math and theoretical computer science.  At Columbia, I have had the privilege of working with Xi Chen on property testing and algorithmic game theory, Eric Balkanski on combinatorial optimization and George Dragomir on computational modeling.  I am also extremely fortunate to have worked with Ralph Morrison as part of the SMALL math REU on chip-firing games.      </p>




        <p>While I keep an open-mind about future areas I will work in, I am particularly drawn towards fields that bridge theory with practice.  For this reason, areas such as optimization, algorithmic game theory, algorithm design and mathematical modeling are of great interest to me. </p>
