        <h2>Steven DiSilvio</h2>

        <p>Hello there! I'm Steven DiSilvio, a current undergraduate at Columbia double-majoring in math and theoretical computer science.  At Columbia, I have had the privilege of working with Eric Balkanski on combinatorial optimization, Xi Chen on property testing and combinatorial games, and George Dragomir on computational modeling.  I am also extremely fortunate to have worked with Ralph Morrison as part of the SMALL math REU on chip-firing games (a type of combinatorial game played on graphs).      </p>




        <p> At the moment, I'm interested in the design of algorithms and optimization theory (especially combinatorial), with a particular interest in their intersection as related to topics such as algorithmic game theory, graph theory and the theoretical foundations of machine learning. I also have experience with computational mathematics and modeling, and am interested in utilizing theoretical techniques to model and solve important practical problems. </p>
